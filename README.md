# Miro
Miro is a conceptual landing page that features time travel.

# Details
Built from an imaginary sign up page, Miro focuses on color. Its blurred background, logo, and even its 'Join' button all feature gradient transitions. Floating blobs use these same styles to mimic a 3D effect and hover icons reflect their colorful counterparts. 

# Additional
Miro is fully responsive, mobile-first, and made entirely from HTML & CSS.
